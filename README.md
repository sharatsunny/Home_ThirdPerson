# Home_ThirdPerson
 
This was the first iteration of home, it was originally inspired by resident evil and as such the main focus on this project was the character itself and the combat, the pacing was also slowed down and the controls are a bit clunky intentionally as to put more focus on the horror aspect. This was also dropped as the leader decided to switch to a first person game instead.
